## is this the Joel you are looking for?

I am not a [Venezuelan baseball][notme] player. You may know me from institutions of  learning such as the [Mississippi School of Math][msms] and Science or the [California Institute of Technology][caltech]. I was born on the gulf coast of Mississippi and lived for many years in Los Angeles. In 2012, My girlfriend and I returned to the south to live in New Orleans, where we live with Mina, Simba, Sadie, Katie, and Desmond.

## can you fix my <span class="strike">printer</span> WIFI ?

I work to make technology that improves people's lives through thoughtful design and delightful details. For almost a decade  i have worked at [Gatekeeper Systems][gks] building digital maps and geospatial applications for utility companies. In 2012, I created [NOLA Transit][nolatransit], an iPhone app for the New Orleans public transit system. 

I am currently working on my second iOS app called [Pinswift][pinswift] - a client for Pinboard.

## so are you a geek like me?

I love to write code in Python and am developing an unusually warm relationship with Objective-C. I've also been spotted programming in Java, Perl, and JavaScript. 

You can see my open source projects on [github][github]. 

## where are the photos of your cats?

I've been posting photos on [Flickr][flickr] since 2005. I also post photos of cats and beautiful moments in my city on [Instagram][instagram].
