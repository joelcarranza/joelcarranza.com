## is this the Joel you are looking for?

I am Mississippi born and a decade long Los Angeles tourist. You may know me from institutions of  learning such as the Mississippi School of Math and Science or the California Institute of Technology. In 2012, My girlfriend and I returned to the south to live in New Orleans. I am not a Venezuelan baseball player.

## can you fix my <span class="strike">printer</span> WIFI ?

Nope - sorry. My goal is to create delightful technology that improves people's lives. I current work as a developer at Gatekeeper Systems where we make digital maps for utility companies. In 2012, I created NOLA Transit, an iPhone app for the New Orleans public transit system.

I am currently working on my second iPhone app called Pinswift.
